# 💻 Assembly Language (MASM 8086) Codes

This repository contains all of my **MASM 8086 Assembly Language programs** developed throughout the semester as part of my coursework.  
The codes are organized to help **learn and practice microprocessor fundamentals** using 8086 instructions.

## 🧠 About MASM 8086 Assembly Language

**Assembly language** is a low-level programming language that is **closely related to a computer's machine code**.  
It allows programmers to write instructions that the CPU executes directly, providing **control over hardware, memory, and registers**.

**MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler)** is a widely used assembler for the **8086 microprocessor** family.  
It converts assembly code into executable machine code and supports macros, structured programming, and advanced instructions.

Key concepts covered in MASM 8086:

- **Data Movement Instructions:** MOV, XCHG, LEA  
- **Arithmetic Operations:** ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, INC, DEC  
- **Logic Instructions:** AND, OR, XOR, NOT, TEST  
- **Control Flow:** JMP, JZ, JNZ, LOOP  
- **String Operations:** MOVS, LODS, STOS, CMPS, SCAS  
- **Interrupts & System Calls:** INT 21h, DOS functions  
- **Stack Operations:** PUSH, POP, CALL, RET

## ⚙️ How to Run MASM 8086 Code

Follow these steps to run `.asm` files in **Visual Studio Code** or MASM environment:

1. **Open VS Code**  
2. **Install MASM Extension** (search "MASM/TASM" in Extensions)  
3. **Create a new `.asm` file** (e.g., `hello.asm`)  
4. **Write your assembly code** in the file  
5. **Run the code:**  
   - Right-click → **Run ASM code**  
   - DOSBox emulator executes the program  

> Notes:
> - MASM uses DOSBox to emulate 8086 instructions  
> - Output appears in the DOSBox window  
> - Ensure standard 8086 assembly syntax is followed
